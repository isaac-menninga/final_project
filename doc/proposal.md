Introduction:
Recent research has been aimed at determining the relationship between climate change and conflict. This research is conducted with the assumption that resource scarcity, and otherwise extreme conditions have a strong influence on the occurrence of conflict. However, determining the causes of conflict is a difficult task. The extent to which different factors (income inequality, social welfare, severe weather, crop yield, etc) affect conflict outcomes is not well understood, and is largely based on speculation (Barnett and Adger). However, climate change will likely have an effect on rates of violence and conflict, particularly in developing countries which lack disaster and crisis management infrastructure. 

This study will examine data on conflict and violence in African countries as well as regional rainfall, temperature, crop yield and weather. By examining empirical evidence, rather than speculating, this study hopes to gain additional insight into how climate change will affect stability in developing countries (Nordås and Gleditsch). Given the findings of previous studies, I predict there will be a correlation between extreme climate and conflict. 


Methods:
This study will look at data about precipitation, temperature, and weather to examine the different regional effects of climate change over time. The focus of the study will be on African countries which have been identified as particularly at risk from climate change (countries in semi-arid and equatorial zones). This data will be analyzed together with data on conflict events in those countries. This study is mostly exploration driven, that is the methods of analysis will change significantly based on the visualization of the data. An approach of this type is effective in this context, because of the uncertainty of conflict analysis, and that the extent that climate change and conflict are correlated is unknown. 


Significance:
Findings from this study could impact the way climate change is discussed at an international level. Most studies on climate change focus on the effects on wealthy nations, as those countries have many research institutions domestically. However, developing countries will likely suffer the most from changes in climate, because of the lack of robust adaptation mechanisms. Additionally, if an economy relies on agriculture for a majority of its economic activity, reduction in crop yield due to climate change could severely harm the wellbeing of individuals in that economy (Hendrix). Once the effects of climate change on these countries is better understood, research should be directed at how to increase the ability of poorer countries to adapt.
